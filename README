# Riley's Standard Library
 * C++'s standard library is bloated and has a lot of oop features. 

 * RSTL is super lightweight and tries not to use OOP features.

 * RSTL is single-header so you don't have to worry about building or installing the library.

 * Currently, RSTL only includes string support and vector support, but it may support more in the future

 * RSTL is designed for RSGL, so it's designed with libraries in mind
